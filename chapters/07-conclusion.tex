\label{Conclusion}

In this bachelor thesis, the field of interactive evolutionary computation and evolution of grammars was described. Also, two methods Genetic Programming and Grammatical Evolution for generating graphical interfaces were described.

Based on the information obtained during writing this thesis, genetic programming was adapted to generate graphical visualizations in Vega framework using the methods of interactive evolutionary computation and grammar evolution. Also, custom mapping of the grammar to JSON syntax was described.

Several techniques for shrinking the size of the search space were implement and described in this thesis. Their implementation lead prevent user fatique.

Three different experiments were done and the number of iteration were measured to confirm functionality of the prototype. The reasons, why the measurements do not have any higher meaning, were also investigated and described.

This bachelor thesis, the prototype and the described heuristic approaches can serve as a promising basis of an application from which a website could arise.
