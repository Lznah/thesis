This bachelor thesis investigates the utilization of evolutionary algorithms for generating graphical interfaces, from a userâ€™s preferences. These graphical interfaces can be described by grammar. Grammar is a set of rules that describes all of the feasible settings of the graphical interfaces.

Additionally, a prototype was created from the information obtained in the initial investigation. The prototype was designed to generate graph visualizations for given datasets. The prototype measures the number of iterations that were used to produce the desired visualization.

The number of iterations does not have any higher meaning as the interactive evolutionary algorithms are dependent on randomness and the user's preferences. Although, the measurements act as a proof-of-concept, indicating that the prototype is functioning as intended.
